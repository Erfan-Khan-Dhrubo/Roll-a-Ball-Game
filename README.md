# Roll a Ball: A Unity Practice Project

**Roll a Ball** is a simple yet engaging 3D game developed in Unity using C#. This project serves as a foundational exercise for learning Unity game development and scripting. It introduces key concepts such as object control, collision detection, scoring systems, and game flow.

---

## Features
- **Player Control**: Navigate the ball using keyboard inputs (arrow keys or WASD).
- **Dynamic Scoring System**: Points are updated in real-time as the player interacts with game objects.
- **Win Condition**: A "You Win!" message is displayed upon collecting all target boxes.
- **Designed for Learning**: The project is structured to provide hands-on experience with Unity basics.
